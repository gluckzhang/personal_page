            	Long Zhang (Gluck Zhang) is now a PhD student in computer science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. He received his BE degree and ME degree in software engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. Before graduation, Long got Tencent internship opportunities twice, with nearly 2 years’ practice in total engaging in software development. After that, as the youngest member of the team and the only graduates being exceptionally hired, he gradually converted from a developer to a project manager, who was responsible for talent cultivation cooperation projects between Tencent and universities, such as Tpai Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competitions, Rhino-bird Elite Graduate Program, etc.
